# LaTeX templates for Eskild Hustvedt

## hib-paper.tex

A LaTeX paper template that fits the style specifications for HiB (Høgskolen i
Bergen/Bergen University College). Citation and bibliography fits the Harvard
style as presented on [Søk og
skriv](http://sokogskriv.no/kildebruk-og-referanser/referansestiler/harvard/).
Requires XeTeX, and uses biblatex instead of bibtex.

## hib-paper-exam.tex

A version of hib-paper.tex that follows the style guidelines more closely by
overriding additional LaTeX formatting like font, margins etc. and adds a
custom header. Suitable for exams and other papers where the formatting is
required to be very close to the guidelines (generally hib-paper.tex will look
better as that uses default LaTeX fonts and margins).

## paper.tex

## specifications.tex

## word-processor-like.tex

A template for writing documents that look like they're made in a word

requirements on how a document should look. Requires XeTeX.
